                                <li>July 10th
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Before this, she was yes/no/yes/no about coming to SD, but she decided to come. Pami Aunty had a role to play. Reecha told me about the bike story of Pami Aunty and Ghanshyam Uncle.</li>
                                        <li>She arrived super late at night. I came up to her at the airport and surprised her from behind.</li>
                                        <li>We were together after, what felt like, the longest time.</li>

                                <li>June 11th - Nirjala
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Toured around UTC Mall</li>
                                        <li>Reecha got Columbus Coffee. Went to mandir. She met with an old friend, Ronica.</li>
                                        <li>Then talked with Romil, Harsh, and Tilak outside. While talking, I pressured Reecha to get the snow cone (because I knew she wanted it).</li>
                                        <li>Had a chance to talk to Carlos, and he let us borrow his car for the next few days.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>June 12th - Zoo
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Woke up kind of early. Reecha had to work for a bit. Made her a bagel and some coffee. Went to the zoo as it opened.</li>
                                        <li>Took a lot of photos. Remembered the first time we went to the zoo.</li>
                                        <li>Towards the end, Reecha was shy to ask for a piggyback photo.</li>
                                        <li>When we left the zoo, we went to Plumaria. It was really good, besides the drink. Then we went to Twiggs Coffee. Got an iced coffee that was really, really good. We changed into our swim clothes.</li>
                                        <li>Went to Mission Beach. Reecha came into the water very hesitantly. We ended up going pretty far. Then walked along the beach for a bit.</li>
                                        <li>Decided to go to Sipz for dinner. Then went back to the apartment for the hot tub.</li>
                                        <li>During that time, we decided to go to Chino Hills (LA) Mandir.</li>
                                        <li>Then we went to sleep.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>June 11th (Second Entry)
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We worked a bit in the morning. Reecha actually worked. We left for LA Mandir. In the car, got called by Avory about my laptop. Talked about my options to Reecha, she got a bit annoyed.</li>
                                        <li>We made it to the Harry Potter-themed coffee shop. Worked there for a bit. Saw that Shayona was closed, so we ate at a Thai place. It was pretty good.</li>
                                        <li>Went to LA Mandir. Got to meet Akandanad Swami. We just missed Abhishek. We did a donation together.</li>
                                        <li>Went to a vegan churro place. I got boba from the side place.</li>
                                        <li>On the way home, we made some tasks to go for the engagement and the reading we are going to do for Chaturmas.</li>
                                        <li>Picked up my laptop from Avory's place on the way back.</li>
                                        <li>Went to the hot tub for a bit. Lost the ring, unfortunately</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Woke up for Reecha’s flight. We left and I gave her a long hug before she walked into the airport. She got through security really quick.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                        <li>July 23rd
                            <ul>
                                <li>Went for Comic Con in the morning, got some stuff.</li>
                                <li>Reecha and the guys moved all of my stuff to Arlington.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>There was a moment where Reecha told me afterward that the guys packed up the bras and stuff that were kept in my drawers.</li>
                                        <li>Dhrupesh ended up taking the black “dresser”, I guess.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>I went to Noah Legall’s place afterward around 4-5 PM.</li>
                                <li>Didn't get to talk to Reecha much that night and she was super tired from moving everything. I wasn't able to give her time and talk to her even though she did a lot for me. I didn't appreciate what she did, I later realized the error of my ways.</li>
                                <li>p.s. reecha, I am very sorry!</li>

                                <li>Super stressful time with the Voterama thingie.</li>
                                <li>I think that is when the headaches really started.</li>
