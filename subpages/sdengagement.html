                        <li>June 18, 19, 20 - Shena Engagement
                            <ul>
                                <li>June 18th
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Got picked up by meet in the morning. Took a nap in Dax's bed. Then went to mandir, where I saw Reecha.</li>
                                        <li>We ended up going to Guru's place. We assembled the bed. Then, when it came time to leave at night, it was super hectic because lodging plans changed all of a sudden. Ba said Shena had to do or leave from a specific location, so I ended up going to Mama's place, the huge mansion. I tried to play it off so Reecha and I could sleep in the basement, but Ghanshyam uncle, Mami, and the guys said they'll just sleep downstairs (bummer).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>June 19th
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Woke up super early and went upstairs. Reecha, Reesha, Shena were still getting ready, and I think Pamli aunty too. Reecha and I cuddled in the bed for a bit. (See mirror selfie). We think aunty opened the door and saw us, but we're not sure.</li>
                                        <li>I annoyed Reecha in the morning when she was having her coffee.</li>
                                        <li>Went to the Vidhi in the morning. I was sitting right behind the livestream camera that Krunal set up. I tried to save a seat for Shena when Santos came, but Mami said that Reecha has to wait for her turn for special treatment (something like that). I clarified that it was for Shena.</li>
                                        <li>Reecha gave me the task to keep Rup and Kishan occupied/give them company.</li>
                                        <li>We took a lot of photos in front of the green screen.</li>
                                        <li>Then we went to Dax's place and took some photos. The one that we both really like...</li>
                                        <li>Then we went to Robby. The decision was very yes/no/yes/no. Did Darshan and Aarti. Saw Dev from Indy and Tejas from Cincy as well as some others. Took a long tour of Robby. Reecha was really annoyed.</li>
                                        <li>Then we decided to go to Top Golf. While waiting in the parking lot, we ate pizza that Guru brought. Took a photo at Top Golf. As we left, we saw supercars at the nearby gas station, Wawa (of course).</li>
                                        <li>Then went back to Mami's place. Guru, Krunal, and I had some of the food that was there.</li>
                                        <li>At night, I remember making a lot of effort to sleep together with Reecha, even though she was feeling sick. We ended up sleeping together on the air mattress next to Guru. I was told by Reecha that Dad saw us sleeping on the mattress.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>June 20th
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We chilled at Guru's place. Got to sleep with each other for a bit. Ended up going on a walk with Mom (see photos).</li>
                                        <li>Then Reecha dropped me off at PHL and cried the whole time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Reecha sent very thoughtful messages throughout the day and a video of her dancing, which is very out of the ordinary since she doesn't like to dance.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Harsh got COVID. Did a lot of tasks for the green card and us living together and such.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
