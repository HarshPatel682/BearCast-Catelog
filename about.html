                        <p>Today is the day! The day we officially, under the eyes of Maharaj, Swami, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, and Mahant Swami Maharaj, join hands for life. It feels unreal, like we’re living a dream, but here we are on one of the biggest days of our lives. We started from the bottom, and now we’re here. Here together, ready for all that's next.</p>
                
                        <p>Reecha, I want to say something I’ve told you before, something I said that one magical night when we did face masks and talked with Rajbhai. I love you. I love you with everything in me. And today, I promise you that this love will only keep growing, stronger with each passing day.</p>
                
                        <p>From the very beginning, I felt very comfortable with you. Every date (with you, me, and the armcast), every conversation, every quiet moment, it all made me realize you were “the one." The one I want to spend my life with. As we talked about our goals and our dreams for the future, I could see it all so clearly - a life of partnership, friendship, and love.</p>
                
                        <p>From the start, we’ve always wanted to be each others' best friends. That’s been our goal, and through it, our love has only gotten stronger. The more we’ve learned about each other: what we each need, how to show up for each other, the closer we’ve gotten. We're continually forming an unbreakable bond, ready to take on anything together.</p>
                
                        <p>Like every couple, we’ve had our ups and downs, our moments of laughter and our moments of learning. But what stands out to me is how we’ve always come back to each other, always left no stone unturned. We’ve built our foundation on trust, honesty, and respect, while always pushing each other to be our best selves. Through it all, my commitment to you has only grown. Reecha, I’m committed to being the best version of me, not just for you but for us. I’m here for you, to be in your corner, in our corner, always.</p>
                
                        <p>If the last few months, heck, or even just the last few weeks, have shown us anything, it’s that our commitment to each other is real and unable to be shaken off. Every step we take, every conversation, every moment, just reminds me of how right this all feels.</p>
                
                        <p>Reecha, you make me want to be a better man. Not just for you, but for myself too. You’ve sparked this whole journey in me, and today, as we start this new chapter, I want you to know that from now until forever, my hand will be holding yours. Just like that day at the DC zoo on our third date, when I nervously asked, “Can I try something?” and went for your hand. Sure, it was a little clumsy and not exactly perfect, but it felt right, like that’s where my hand was meant to be. So, whether we’re holding hands perfectly or a little awkwardly, I’ll be holding your hand for the rest of our lives.</p>
                
                        <p>I love you Reecha. You are mine and I am yours.</p>
                
                        <p class="signature">With all my love and my heart,<br>Your big cuddly bear,<br>Harsh Patel</p>
